Company Logo Files Needed:

1. google-logo.svg - Google company logo (SVG format preferred for scalability)
2. wmg-logo.svg - Warner Music Group company logo (SVG format preferred)

These logos should be:
- SVG format for crisp display at all sizes
- Appropriate for use on dark backgrounds (white/light colored logos work best)
- Sized appropriately (the CSS will handle scaling to 60px containers)

You can obtain these logos from:
- Company brand/press kit pages
- Official brand guidelines
- Logo download portals (ensure proper licensing)

Once added, the timeline experience cards will display the respective company logos alongside the job titles and dates.
